This is a program that displays a unified schedule for various disciplines. First, the student chooses his faculty, specialty and today's day and week of study. Then the program parses pairs (lectures and practices) from the xml file of its specialty or faculty. Next, the student needs to choose his disciplines and groups. Congratulations, now your personal schedule is ready and can be viewed (for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday... or immediately for a week or for today).
