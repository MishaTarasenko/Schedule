<h4 style="text-align:center">This project is written in Java using standard library</h4>
This is a program that displays a unified schedule for various disciplines. First, the student chooses his faculty, specialty and today's day and week of study. Then the program parses pairs (lectures and practices) from the xml file of its specialty or faculty. Next, the student needs to choose his disciplines and groups. Congratulations, now your personal schedule is ready and can be viewed (for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday... or immediately for a week or for today).

<h3 style="text-align:center">Installation and usage instructions</h3>
Create a copy of the repositories on your computer or download the zip file. Open the project in your development environment and run it. Next, the program will ask you to select a faculty, specialty and enter the current study week and day. After that, the program will select the disciplines available for your specialty and you will have to choose yours and select a group for them. Congratulations, your schedule is ready, and then you just need to choose which output option is convenient for you. (Everything is demonstrated in detail in the video)
